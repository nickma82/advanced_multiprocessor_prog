%\begin{theorem}{x.yz} %You can use theorem, proposition, exercise, or reflection here.  Modify x.yz to be whatever number you are proving
%Delete this text and write theorem statement here.
%\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Blah, blah, blah.  Here is an example of the \texttt{align} environment:
%Note 1: The * tells LaTeX not to number the lines.  If you remove the *, be sure to remove it below, too.
%Note 2: Inside the align environment, you do not want to use $-signs.  The reason for this is that this is already a math environment. This is why we have to include \text{} around any text inside the align environment.
\begin{align*}
\sum_{i=1}^{k+1}i & = \left(\sum_{i=1}^{k}i\right) +(k+1)\\ 
& = \frac{k(k+1)}{2}+k+1 & (\text{by inductive hypothesis})\\
& = \frac{k(k+1)+2(k+1)}{2}\\
& = \frac{(k+1)(k+2)}{2}\\
& = \frac{(k+1)((k+1)+1)}{2}.
\end{align*}
\end{proof}
 
\begin{proposition}{x.yz}
Let $n\in \Z$.  
\end{proposition}
 
\begin{proof}[Disproof]%Whatever you put in the square brackets will be the label for the block of text to follow in the proof environment.
Blah, blah, blah.  I'm so smart.
\end{proof}
